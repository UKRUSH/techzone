# 🔧 CRUD Flow Testing Instructions

## 🐛 Error Fix: User Data 404

**Issue Resolved**: The 404 error occurs when users try to access the profile page without being signed in.

**Solution**: Updated profile page to show proper authentication prompts with test credentials.

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Testing

### 1. **Test Authentication**
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/profile
2. You should see a sign-in prompt with test credentials
3. Click "Sign In" or go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin

### 2. **Sign In with Test User**
Use any of these test credentials:
- **Admin**: admin@techzone.com / admin123
- **User 1**: user@techzone.com / user123  
- **User 2**: jane@techzone.com / user123

### 3. **Test Profile Page**
After signing in:
1. Go to `/profile` - should show real user data
2. Click "Edit Profile" - should allow editing
3. Update name/email/phone/address
4. Click "Save Changes" - should update database

### 4. **Test Cart Flow**
1. Sign out (if signed in)
2. Go to `/products` 
3. Add items to cart as guest
4. Go to `/cart`
5. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
6. Choose "Register" or "Sign In"
7. Complete auth → cart should merge

## 🔍 Debugging Information

### API Endpoints Status:
- ✅ `GET /api/user` - Returns 401 when not authenticated (correct)
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/register` - Working
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/signin` - Working
- ✅ Database connection - Working (3 users found)

### Error Details:
- **Before**: 404 error shown to user (confusing)
- **After**: Proper authentication prompt with test credentials

### Test Users in Database:
```
Found 3 users:
- Admin User (admin@techzone.com) - ADMIN
- John Doe (user@techzone.com) - BUYER  
- Jane Smith (jane@techzone.com) - BUYER
```

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

1. **Unauthenticated users**: See sign-in prompt with test credentials
2. **Authenticated users**: See real profile data from database
3. **Profile editing**: Works with validation and saves to DB
4. **Cart persistence**: Guest cart merges with user cart on login

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the full flow** using the provided credentials
2. **Verify cart merging** by adding items as guest, then signing in
3. **Test profile editing** by updating user information
4. **Confirm data persistence** by signing out and back in

The CRUD flow is now properly implemented with better error handling and user guidance!
